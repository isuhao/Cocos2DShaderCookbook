Cocos2DShaderCookbook
=====================

Cocos2D v3 includes a new rendering engine with vastly improved support for shaders. This cookbook provides example shaders and shader best practices that will be useful in your Cocos2D game.

These shaders are easily tweakable to fit your needs. They are presented in an interactive demo app so it's easy to scroll through the shaders and find the one you want.
