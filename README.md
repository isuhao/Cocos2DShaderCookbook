# Cocos2DShaderCookbook

Cocos2D v3.1 includes a new rendering engine with vastly improved support for shaders. This project is intended as both a beginner introduction to writing shaders for Cocos2D as well as a "cook book" of ideas to make your own.

First of all, you'll want to do a recursive Git checkout since it has a Git submodule for Cocos2D.

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/slembcke/Cocos2DShaderCookbook.git
  
Each of the examples is fairly self contained and includes an explanation to go along with the code. If you've never written a shader before, you'll want to start at the beginning since the explanations are meant to be read in order.

Good luck!
